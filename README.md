Project Description
TimeShare is a web-based platform designed to empower communities by facilitating skill-sharing and time-banking. Users can join the platform to exchange their skills and services, earn credits for their contributions, and utilize those credits to avail services from others. Itâ€™s a collaborative, user-friendly solution to promote skill utilization, community engagement, andÂ mutualÂ support.

The Problem statement
In many communities, individuals have unused skills or free time but lack money to access needed services. Additionally, modern communities often struggle with fostering interpersonal connections andÂ mutualÂ support.

The Solution
TimeShare is a platform that enables users to exchange skills and services using time credits. Instead of money, users trade hours of service, promoting a sense of community and reducing reliance on traditionalÂ currencies.
