Project Description
TimeShare is a web-based platform designed to empower communities by facilitating skill-sharing and time-banking. Users can join the platform to exchange their skills and services, earn credits for their contributions, and utilize those credits to avail services from others. It‚Äôs a collaborative, user-friendly solution to promote skill utilization, community engagement, and¬†mutual¬†support.

The Problem statement
In many communities, individuals have unused skills or free time but lack money to access needed services. Additionally, modern communities often struggle with fostering interpersonal connections and¬†mutual¬†support.

The Solution
TimeShare is a platform that enables users to exchange skills and services using time credits. Instead of money, users trade hours of service, promoting a sense of community and reducing reliance on traditional¬†currencies.
